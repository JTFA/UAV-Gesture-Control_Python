# Tello-Gesture-Control
This project is made by Chinese Univeristy of Hong Kong, Shenzhen(CUHKSZ) and Stanford.

The goal is to control the UAV Tello by hand gesture or body pose.

## Simple Control 
You can use the files in Simple-Control. The message is sent as string to Tello and the response will feed back to PC.

## Tellopy Control
The Tellopy can be installed by pip. But When I intall 'av' by pip, the error occured and I can't fix it. The easy method to solve is to use Anaconda by running

$conda install av -c conda-forge
